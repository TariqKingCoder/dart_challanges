    DART CHALLANGES
 ---------------------------------------- */

 /* EASY CHALLANGES
    1 -> Write program that sum two numbers
      TIPS: USE PLUS(+) OPERATORS
      BONUS: TAKE RUNTIME INPUTS FROM USER
      E.G -> INPUT NUMBERS: (2,3), OUTPUT: 5
    2 -> Write program that compare given two numbers
      TIPS: use relational operators (>, <, ==) to print which one is greater or if they are equal.
      BONUS: TAKE RUNTIME INPUTS FROM USER
      E.G -> INPUT NUMBERS: (2,3), OUTPUT: BASED ON OPERATORS
    3 -> Write a Dart program that takes an integer and prints its square
      TIPS: using the multiplication operator (*)

 */

 /* INTERMEDIATE CHALLANGES
    1 ->  Write program that find odd and even numbers
      TIPS: USE if, else statement
      BONUS: TAKE RUNTIME INPUTS FROM USER
      E.G -> INPUT NUMBERS: 22 , OUTPUT:  22 is even
    2 -> Write a program that checks if a student’s score is between 50 and 100 
      TIPS: using logical operators (&&, ||).
      BONUS: USE GRADES(A+,A,B,C,D)
    3 -> Evaluate the result of: int result = 10 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 2;
      TIPS: Based On Operator Precedence
      BONUS: Show step-by-step how Dart applies operator precedence.

 */
 /* HARD CHALLANGES
    1 -> Write program that change decimal number into binary
      TIPS: USE LOOP, MODULES(%) AND DIVISION(/) OPERATORS 
      BONUS: TAKE RUNTIME INPUT FROM USER
      E.G -> INPUT NUMBER: 12, OUTPUT: 1100

    2 -> Write program that change binary number into decimal
      TIPS: USE LOOP, MODULES(%) AND DIVISION(/) OPERATORS
      BONUS: TAKE RUNTIME INPUT FROM USER
      E.G -> INPUT NUMBER: 1100, OUTPUT: 12

    3 -> Write program that sum the digits of an input number
      TIPS: USE LOOP, MODULES(%) AND DIVISION(/) OPERATORS
      BONUS: TAKE RUNTIME INPUT FROM USER
      E.G -> INPUT : 12, OUTPUT (1 + 2): 3
